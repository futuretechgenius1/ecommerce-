- [x] Authentication endpoints (/auth/*)
- [x] Catalog endpoints (/catalog/*)
- [x] Cart and order endpoints (/cart/*, /order/*)
- [x] Admin endpoints (/admin/*)

## Phase 6: Angular Frontend
- [ ] Angular 16+ project with routing
- [ ] Components for login, register, catalog, cart, checkout, admin
- [ ] Services for API communication
- [ ] Angular Material for UI components
- [ ] JWT token handling and route guards

## Phase 7: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Service registration with Eureka
- [ ] End-to-end API testing
- [ ] Frontend-backend integration
